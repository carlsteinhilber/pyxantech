RECOMMENDED

Copy the xantech.service file from the root of the project to the /lib/systemd/system/ directory of the Pi

Then enable it as a service
 >sudo systemctl daemon-reload
 >sudo systemctl enable xantech
 >sudo systemctl start xantech

Or, you can run it manually from the command line or SSH terminal

Use
 >python app.py

instead of
 >flask run


this will start the app as a production webserver using socketio.run() and eventlet (if installed).

Otherwise it will be a development server and produce lots of errors.
